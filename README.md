# Radical Ethereum Token

Basic ERC20 token on Solidity 0.4.24. Includes updated constructor definitions.

You can deploy immediately by downloading [Metamask](https://metamask.io/) and going to Ethereum's in-browser [Remix IDE](https://remix.ethereum.org/).

Before going live on the Ethereum mainnet, you can test for free on a test network like Ropsten.

In the contract code, set:
1. The token name.
2. The token symbol.
3. The total supply.
4. (Optional) the desired number of decimals.
3. The supply account address.
4. The token distribution addresses.

In Remix:
1. Compile (and address any errors/warnings!).
2. Switch to the run tab.
3. Set the environment to 'Injected Web3' and address to your supply address.
4. In the drop-down menu, select your token name.
5. Hit deploy.
